# xmledit-cookbook

This cookbook allows incremental editing of XML files. You must include the
default recipe to ensure nokogiri and its dependencies are installed using the
upstream community xml cookbook.

**Here be dragons**. This is definitely not idempotent, and is not the best way to manage a file in chef. clintoncwolfe has [described why you should not use this](https://github.com/clintoncwolfe/xml_edit#why-you-should-seriously-not-use-this). Please read his thoughts on the matter.

Specifically, this library cookbooks offers a resource and provider that can be
called by the name `xml_edit`. This resource accepts XPath expressions and will
perform the expected action on the very first node found.

## Important notes

- If no XML nodes match the XPath expression, no actions will be performed. If a
file cannot be found, this provider will raise an error by virtue of `::File`
raising an error.

- This cookbook attempts to sidestep resource cloning issues by forcing the
resource name to be something other than a path to a file to edit. This allows
you to perform multiple edits to the same file by giving the resources unique
names and providing the same path attribute value. You may also do a bulk edit,
if you know in advance all the edits that should be happening to a file.

- Including an XPath expression that is a match against the node's value that
you want to replace (e.g. matching against `[text=()=\'false\']` if you want to
replace false with true) means that the underlying file resource will no longer
be defined, vs. having a file resource that was defined but idempotently 'up to
date'. Both styles are possible using this cookbook, depending on the XPath
expressions you provide.

## Supported actions

|name|description|
|----|:-----------:|
|replace|replaces a target node (and all children) with a new fragment|
|append|appends a new XML fragment to a parent target node|
|append_if_missing|if target is found, replace with fragment, otherwise append fragment|
|remove|remove gets rid of a target node|
|bulk|pass a hash of the above actions, do them all and write file out once after|

## Supported attributes

These have no default values, and will cause a no-op if they are not specified or don't match a valid file or target.

|name|description|
|----|:-----------:|
|path|path to the XML file to edit|
|target|an xpath expression for the target node (see action replace and append_if_missing above)|
|parent|an xpath expression for the parent of the target node (see actions append and append_if_missing above)|
|fragment|a string that will be parsed into an XML fragment, for actions that add or update|
|edits|an array of hashes, with each hash containing one or zero keys of: `:action`, `:path`, `:targent`, `:parent`, or `:fragment`|

Checkout nokogiri's documentation on [XPath and search](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/searching_a_xml_html_document.html) to understand the syntax behind `target` and `parent` attributes.

## Examples

Replace `false` with `true` in a file at `/etc/application.xml` containing `<config><foo>false</foo></config>`.

```
xml_edit 'set foo to true' do
  path '/etc/application.xml'
  target '/config/foo[text()=\'false\']'
  fragment '<foo>true</foo>'
  action :replace
end
```

```
xml_edit '/tmp/xmledit_bulk_test.xml' do
  edits [
    {action: :replace, target: '/foo/bar', fragment: '<bar>xyzzy</bar>'},
    {action: :append, parent: '/foo', target: '/foo/baz', fragment: '<baz>true</baz>'},
    {action: :remove, target: '/foo/hideme'},
    {action: :append_if_missing, parent: '/foo', target: '/foo/showme', fragment: '<showme/>'}
    ]
  action :bulk
end
```

## TODO

 - Add an attribute for forcing an error when an xpath expr doesn't match
